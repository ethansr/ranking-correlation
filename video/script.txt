Harrison et al. used Weber's law to model the perception of correlation in 9 visualization types at different levels of r. They took adjusted within-condition means and fit linear models to them, discarding individual variation.

In a secondary analysis of that work, we instead fit log-linear (non-Weber) models directly to the data, addressing non-constant variance and skewed residuals.

We also use censoring to account for outliers.

Our final Bayesian model allows us to group visualization techniques by expected performance on an unknown dataset.

We also discuss data sharing, replication, and Bayesian methods.
